This example is functionally equivalent to the previous while-loops program

To compile:

    gcc -Wall main.c -o while-loops

To run:

    ./while-loops

Output:

  example 1 -- invalid input

    Hello, please enter a starting number: 5
    Hello, please enter a ending number (must be greater than 5): 5
    error: the supplied ending number 5 was not greater than 5

  example 2 -- valid input:

    Hello, please enter a starting number: -2
    Hello, please enter a ending number (must be greater than -2): 4
    -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 
    goodbye
