Output:

  example 1 -- pressing the keys: 4 <enter> 6 <enter> -3 <enter>

    Give me a positive number and I will square it; if the number is negative I will exit.
    enter number: 4
    the squared value of 4 is 16
    enter number: 6
    the squared value of 6 is 36

    together we squared 2 values

  example 2 -- pressing the keys: 88 <enter> 99 <enter> -7 <enter>

    Give me a positive number and I will square it; if the number is negative I will exit.
    enter number: 88
    the squared value of 88 is 7744
    enter number: 99
    I really like this number.
    the squared value of 99 is 9801
    enter number: -7

  example 3 -- pressing the keys: 0 <enter>

    Give me a positive number and I will square it; if the number is negative I will exit.

    surprise! i'm going to exit even though 0 isn't really negative
